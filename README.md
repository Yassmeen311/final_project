# final_project
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Early detection and
prediction of stroke risk can save lives and improve healthcare services. This project utilizes
machine learning to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on various
health and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, and medical history.

Project Scope:

• Data collection and preprocessing using the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and correlations.

• Feature selection and engineering to improve model performance.

• Model training and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms.

• Model optimization and fine-tuning for better accuracy.
